        <h2>Hi, I'm OÅ¾bej. Nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p class="desc-text">I started my Computer Science journey in 2014, when I enrolled in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Velenje. I am currently studying Computer and Information science
            in Faculty of Computer and Information Science Ljubljana. In my free time I like to learn new relevant technologies, frameworks and programming languages.
            I am always ready to learn, confident, curious and working on improving my programming skills.
